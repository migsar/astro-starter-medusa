## Getting started

This project was created using Astro minimal starter.

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Available commands:

| Command             | Action                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm i`            | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
